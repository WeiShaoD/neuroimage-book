Neuroimage dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a standard for organizing, annotating, and describing data collected during neuroimaging experiments. It is based on a formalized file/folder structure and JSON based metadata files with controlled vocabulary A standardized directory tree such as this makes scripting much easier.

The Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) is an open file format[1] commonly used to store brain imaging data obtained using Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods.

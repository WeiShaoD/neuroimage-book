What is FreeSufer?

FreeSurfer is a brain imaging software package. It focuses on analyzing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of brain tissue, functional brain mapping and contains tools to conduct both volume-based and surface-based analysis.


FreeSurfer includes tools for the reconstruction of topologically correct and geometrically accurate models of both the gray/white and pial surfaces, for measuring cortical thickness, surface area and folding, and for computing inter-subject registration based on the pattern of cortical folds.

Exploring the Resting State Neural Activity in language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Individuals who speak more than one language have been found to enjoy a number of benefits not directly associated with the use of the languages themselves. 
One of these benefits is that bilingual individuals appear to develop symptoms of dementia 4-5 years later than comparable individuals who speak just one 
language. Studies on this topic, however, do not necessarily account for factors including if the individual learned their second language as a child or 
later in life, or their language proficiency. In an attempt to more carefully examine these variables, this study looks at structural and resting-state 
functional MRI scans of the default mode network, English and Spanish (where applicable) proficiency, language background, and demographics of young healthy 
adults who fall into one of three groups: early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and monolinguals.

Check the preprocessed data
===========================

After the script generated by uber_subject.py has completed, navigate to the directory containing the preprocessed data. By default, AFNI will create a new directory tree in the following format:

cd sub-02/subject_results/group.BART/subj.sub_02/sub_02.results

In which subjects name and group name are specified in the subject ID and group ID tab from the uber_subject.py GUI we did.

Navigating to the Preprocessed Data Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can see all the different images and files from each step of preprocessing. Start from **mask...* 

Example output from uber_subject.py. The files containing the “pb” string are the preprocessed 
 functional images at each preprocessing step, and the files with the “T1w” string are the preprocessed anatomical images. Auxiliary functional images are created to assist with specific preprocessing 
 steps, and auxiliary text files contain information about transformation matrices and movement parameters. the files that contain the string pb01 (i.e., Processing Block 01), and the string tshift, 
 means that these
images have been slice-time corrected using the "3dTshift" command.

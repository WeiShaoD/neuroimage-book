AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages) is a software suite developed by C, Python, R programs and shell scripts, it is built for the analysis and display of multiple MRI modalities: anatomical, 
functional MRI (FMRI) and diffusion weighted (DW) data. It is freely available for research purposes. The software is made to run on virtually any Unix system with X11 and Motif displays. Binary packages 
are provided for MacOS and Linux systems such as Fedora, CentOS/Red Hat and Ubuntu (which includes the Windows Subsystem for Linux).

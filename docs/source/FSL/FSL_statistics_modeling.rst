Statistics and modeling
================

After we finish all the preprocessing steps, we can go to the next - fit a model to the data. For a bettwe understanding of model fitting, we need to review some 3 fundamental components; 

  1 General Linear Model 
  2 The BOLD response 
  3 Time-series

General linear model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In General Linear Model, or GLM. we can use one or more regressors - independent variables, to fit a model for some outcome measure - or dependent variable. To do this we compute numbers called beta weights, which are the relative weights assigned to each regressor to best fit the data. Any discrepancies between the model and the data are called residuals.

Although the script can help you to run all the 34 subjects, But it is recommended to run subjects one by one so you can familair all the processes

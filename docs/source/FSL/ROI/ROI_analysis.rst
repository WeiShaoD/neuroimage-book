ROI analysis
============

As we just completed a group-level analysis, and identified some regions of the brain show a significant difference under the condition of the 
experiment.Now, we are going to continue our learning with region of analysis(ROI). This is called a whole-brain or exploratory analysis. When the 
investigator doesn't have a hypothesis to test, these types of studies are beneficial.


When a large number of studies have been run about a specific topic, however, we can begin to make more specific hypotheses about where we should find our 
results in the brain images. For example, cognitive control has been studied for many years, and many fMRI studies have been published about it using 
different paradigms that compare more cognitively demanding tasks to less cognitively demanding tasks. Often, significant increases in the BOLD signal during 
cognitively demanding conditions are seen in a region of the brain known as the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, or dmPFC for short. For the Flanker study, 
then, we could restrict our analysis to this region and only extract data from voxels within that region. This is known as a region of interest (ROI) 
analysis. A general name for an analysis in which you choose to analyze a region selected before you look at whole-brain results is called a confirmatory 
analysis.

Whole-brain maps can hide important details about the effects that weâ€™re studying. We may find a significant effect of incongruent-congruent, but the reason the effect is significant could be because incongruent is greater than congruent, or because congruent is much more negative than congruent, or some combination of the two. The only way to determine what is driving the effect is with ROI analysis, and this is especially important when dealing with interactions and more sophisticated designs.

Balloon Analogue Risk Task
==========================

One of the interesting topics from psychology is risky behavior. In order to gain a bettering understanding about how the brain reacts when people make a decision, Researchers created many interesting paradigms, Ballon analog risk task is one of them.

Balloon analog risk task(BART). a xperimental paradigms in which participants can manipulate the Ballon to control the risk and reward. Tom Schonberg and his colleagues scanned participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task, an experimental measure that includes an active decision/choice component. As the pictur shows, in this task, escalating risk-taking occurs under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to increasing possible losses and decreasing expected value.

In the BART, subjects inflate simulated balloons, and accrue monetary rewards for each successive “pump” during a particular trial. A trial is defined as a balloon that can be pumped a certain number of times and the trial can conclude in two different ways. On the one hand, the participant can “cash-out” at any point during the trial and secure the cumulative winnings up to that point for that balloon in their cumulative total “bank.” On the other hand, a balloon may explode; in this case, participants would lose the money accumulated on that trial alone (but not the total accumulated during previous cash-out trials). Each trial began with a balloon displaying a value of $0.25 and the value of the balloon increased by $0.25 for each successive pump. During each trial, participants were presented with one of three types of “reward” balloons, each having a different explosion probability and signified by a different color: red, green, or blue. As a control task, participants intermittently inflated a gray “control” balloon (maximum 12 pumps) that did not explode and had no associated monetary value. The participants were instructed to inflate the control balloon until it disappeared from the screen, and the next trial began. Unlike with reward balloons, participants had no control over how many times they could inflate the control balloon before the trial ended. The order in which trials were presented was randomized among these four balloons

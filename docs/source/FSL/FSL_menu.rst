The goal of this chapter is to show you how to run fMRI analysis with FSL step by step. After successfully install FSL and set up, we are going to analyze a dataset with FSL so that we can gain some 
first-hand experiences. The data is Ballon Analogue Risk Task.


We will start with the dataset downloading, preprocessing, 1st level, 2nd level, and 3rd level analysis as follow:

1 Ballon Analogue Risk Task and data downloading

2 preprocessing

3 statistics and modeling

4 1st level analysis

5 automated the data

6 2nd level analysis

7 3rd level analysis

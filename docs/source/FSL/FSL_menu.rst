What is FSL?

FSL (The FMRIB Software) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. It runs on Apple and PCs (both Linux, and Windows via a Virtual Machine),  Most of the tools can be run both from the command line and as GUIs ("point-and-click" graphical user interfaces)

After successful install FSL and set it up, let's analyze the data to gain some first-hand experience. You can find date from `OpenNeuro <https://openneuro.org/>`__ as I introduced before. This goal of this chapter is to show you how to run fMRI analysis with FSL step by step.

We will start with the downloading of the data and inspecting the anatomical and functional images.Then, do preprocessing with the data, Once the preprocessing has been done, we will do further 1st and 2nd level analysis with the statistics model.

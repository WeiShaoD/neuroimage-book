FSL introduction
================

What is FSL?

FSL (The FMRIB Software) is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. It runs on Apple and PCs (both Linux, and Windows via a Virtual Machine), Most of the tools 
can be run both from the command line and as GUIs ("point-and-click" graphical user interfaces)

After successfully install FSL and set up. letâ€™s analyze a dataset to gain some first-hand experiences. You can find data from `OpenNeuro <https://neuroimage-book02.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenNeuro/OpenNeuro_menu.html/>`_

The goal of this chapter is to show you how to run fMRI analysis with FSL step by step.

We will start with the dataset downloading, preprocessing, 1st level, 2dn level, and 3rd level analysis as follow:

1 downloading the data

2 Ballon Analogue Risk Task

3 preprocessing

4 statistics and modeling

5 1st level analysis

6 script

7 2nd level analysis

8 3rd level analysis

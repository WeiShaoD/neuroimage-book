Resting-state fMRI
******************

Resting-State Functional Connectivity (RSC) is a kind of study that indicated the significant correlation of signal between functionally related brain
regions in the absence of any stimulus or task stimulus or task. This correlated signal arises from spontaneous low-frequency signal fluctuations (SLFs). A
lot of the time series of voxels correlated significantly (after filtering the fundamental and harmonics of respiration and heart rates) while only a few
voxel time courses (< 3%) correlated with those in regions outside of the motor cortex. Subsequently, there are some evidence indicated that the presence of
RSC in sensory cortices, specifically auditory and visual cortices. In a study, signal from visual cortex voxels during rest was used as a reference and
correlated with every other voxel in the brain. A significant number of voxels from the visual cortex passed a threshold of 0.35, while only a few voxels
from outside the visual cortex passed the threshold. some similar results also appear in the auditory cortex.

Louvain method
==============

The Louvain method is a method to extract communities from large networks created by Blondel et 
al from the University of Louvain (the source of this method's name). The method is a greedy 
optimization method that appears to run in time {\displaystyle O(n\cdot \log n)}O(n\cdot \log n) 
if {\displaystyle n}n is the number of nodes in the network.[2]

Why we need study FC? Because the clinic application

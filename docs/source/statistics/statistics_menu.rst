Power staatistics 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Power analysis is directly related to tests of hypotheses. While we conducting tests based on different hypotheses, there are two types of errors researchers 
can make: Type I error and Type II error. Statistical power mainly deals with Type II errors.In general, it is worth to note that the higher the sample size, 
the easier it will be to obtain the 0.05 level of significance. However, if the sample size is too small, the investigator may make a Type II error due to 
insufficient power.

Data collection is usually preceded by a power analysis. The principal goal of power analysis is to assist researchers in determining the minimum sample size 
necessary to detect the effect of a given test at the desired level of significance. The reason for doing power analysis is that we would prefer a lower 
sample size because larger samples are frequently more expensive. The significance testing is also improved with smaller samples.

Factors That Affect Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are certain factors that affect power in power analysis

The ideal power level for power analysis has a significant is normally 0.80, but when you conducting the power analysis, we can specify a higher level, such 
as 0.90, which means the researcher has a 90% chance of not making a type II error.

The degree of significance is one of the most important elements in power analysis. Assume that we specifies a level of significance of 0.001. The power of 
power analysis will be reduced in this instance. As a result, an alpha level of 0.001 is only appropriate in cases when the researcher is primarily concerned 
with avoiding a Type I error.

The strength of association between the two variables is another aspect that influences the power of an analysis. To be more specific, the stronger the 
relationship, the bigger the power in the power analysis. This indicates that in power analysis, a stronger correlation leads to a higher power number.

In power analysis, a factor called sensitivity can impact the power. For example, the number of genuine positives out of the total number of true positives 
and false negatives is referred to as sensitivity. To put it another way, the power analysis effect recognises the actually rectified data. This means that 
highly sensitive data will generate data with a higher power value in power analysis, implying that the experimenters will be less likely to make a Type II 
error as a result of the data.

The power is also affected by the variation in the dependent variable. The greater the variation in the dependent variable, the more likely the researcher 
make make Type II mistakes. This means that the power value in power analysis will be lower.

Assumptions of Power Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a power analysis, there are two assumptions. **Random sampling** is the initial premise of analysis. This indicates that the sample on which the power 
analysis is performed is obtained using a random sampling technique.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

Of course, there are certain limitations for power analysis. Certain software packages do not take into account the aspects that affect power, thus we should 
be aware of this. Certain software's power analysis may suggest sample sizes that are smaller than the appropriate sample size for a certain technique. In 
other words, power analysis can provide guidance for sample size, but it cannot account for the complexity that a researcher may encounter when conducting 
study.

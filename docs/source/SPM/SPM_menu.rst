What is SPM?

SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) is an interactive application that performs statistical analyses of brain imaging data. SPM refers to the construction and assessment of spatially extended 
statistical processes to test functional imaging data. The data could be a series of images from different cohorts or time-series from the same subject. The current release version of SPM, SPM12, is 
designed for the analysis of fMRI, PET, SPECT, EEG and MEG. SPM12 has had several updates since 2014. First released 1st October 2014 and last updated 13th January 2020

Downloading and Installing SPM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike AFNI or FSL, SPM is able to run on any operating system as long as it has Matlab installed. Matlab is proprietary software that is quite expensive, but if you are a student or university employee 
you may be able to obtain a copy for free. Once you have installed Matlab, the `SPM website <https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/>`__ has instructions on how to install the software package. 
Click on the “download form” button to fill out some personal details such as your position and what you will be using the software for, which will enable you to download the software.

Preprocessing
=============

Remember our drink menu? It is a little different for what we should do in SPM but overall there are very similar, Anyway, letâ€™s have a couple of drinks before the meal

Since we have download and rename the dataset, let's look at our data first to check if there are any artifacts or problems with the image data. call the ``Matlab`` and navigate to **BART_spm** directory.

As you saw in the previous Data Download page, the dataset has a standardized structure: Each subject folder contains an anatomical directory and a functional directory labeled anat and func, and these 
in turn contain the anatomical and functional images collected during the experiment. (The func directory also contains onset times, or timestamps for when the subject underwent either a Congruent or 
Incongruent trial.) This format is known as BIDS, or Brain Imaging Data Structure, which makes it easy to organize and analyze your data.
